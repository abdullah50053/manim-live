# Manim Scenes

This repository contains various Manim scenes demonstrating different shapes, transformations, and animations.

Each Python file (e.g., `scene.py`) contains classes representing distinct scenes.  To run a specific scene, use the `manim` command-line tool.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
manim -pql scene.py CreateCircle
```

Replace `CreateCircle` with the name of the scene you want to render.

**Setup Instructions:**

1.  **Install Manim:**
    ```bash
    pip install manim
    ```
